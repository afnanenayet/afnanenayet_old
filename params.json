{"name":"Minigma","tagline":"Secure your messages.","body":"### Welcome to Minigma\r\nMinigma is a small basic attempt at encryption. A seed is generated based on a user input which creates a cypher which can be used to encode/decode messages. The entire program is local, with no network access whatsoever.\r\n\r\n### Installation Requirements\r\nInstallation of this project requires any version of Windows if you use the .exe provided at the bottom.\r\nAdditionally, if you use the installer, you will need to download the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 redistributable](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).\r\n\r\n##Download/Install for Windows (any version)\r\nIf you want to download the executable file for Minigma, please download it [here](https://app.box.com/minigma).\r\n\r\n\r\n###Files:\r\n```\r\nstdafx.h**\r\nstdafx.cpp**\r\nMinigma.cpp\r\ndecode.cpp\r\ndecode.h\r\nencoder.cpp\r\nencoder.h\r\nglobalvars.h\r\ntargetver.h**\r\n```\r\n*Was compiled using the MS VS2013 compiler.\r\n\r\n**If you want to compile the project for any OS besides Windows remove these files.\r\n\r\n##How does it work?\r\nThe program generates a seed based on a user input (the password). This password is converted to an integer which is used as the seed for the pseudo-random generator which manipulates an array to create a cipher. A \"standard\" cipher is used to convert the characters entered by the user into the corresponding characters in the generated cipher. This places the entire burden of security on the password rather than the system.\r\n\r\n##Statistics:\r\nPercentage of messages that have been intercepted by the NSA:  | Percentage of messages that are so secure even God can't touch them:\r\n------------- | -------------\r\n0%  | 100%\r\n\r\n\r\n#Testimony\r\n>\"This can literally stop the NSA.\"\r\n>_-Edward Snowden_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
