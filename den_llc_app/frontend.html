				<h2>The internship</h2>
				<p>
					My freshman year, I applied to an internship with Microsoft on a whim. I never expected to get in, but I ended up getting
					a phone interview. Still, I hadn't gotten the interview, so I didn't think much of it. I passed the phone interview,
					flew down to Seattle, and to my surprise, I got an interview.
				</p>

				<p>
					In Seattle, I worked with two other interns on the Windows team. Our managers gave us a seemingly easy task. We were supposed
					to create a framework that would efficiently analyze the APIs that every application in the Windows database uses, and
					provide minimal tests that give full coverage over each new release of Windows.
				</p>

				<p>
					At first, we expected the project to be fairly easy. As we started to delve into the project, we got hit with more and more
					curveballs - we came across more bugs, and we realized that we had made some critical mistakes. It was extremely successful,
					our managers knew that we had a hard project - they told us not to worry if we didn't finish the project. We knew that
					not finishing a project would ensure that we didn't get a return offer. We had to finish, for the sake of our careers.
				</p>

				<p>
					I worked with my fellow interns. We came in on weekends, we stayed after hours, we did everything we could, everything we
					had to do in order to make sure we completed this project. We collaborated as well as we could, we taught each other
					everything we knew, we talked to our managers, engineers, and people from other teams so we could get advice and to
					make sure that we had all the knowledge we needed in order to finish the project.
				</p>

				<p>
					For a few weeks, we were absolutely sure that we weren't going to be able to finish the project. We figured it was over,
					and we continued doing are work, hoping to get at least something done before we completed our internships. We had some
					critical "eureka" moments, and we started to realize that we had gotten a lot more work done than we thought - we had
					hope. As the weeks went by, we spent more and more time in the office, almost obsessed with the project. We ended up
					finishing only a few hours before the deadline, and we all got return offers. We put our faith in each other, gave it
					our best effort, and we created a tool that was put into production by Microsoft, that is maintained by two full time
					employees.

				<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
				<p>
					There is something captivating about creating something. I love seeing things go from vague concepts in my head to a product,
					something tangible that gives me something to show for my efforts and my ideas. I define entrepreneurship as the creation
					of something new. It’s a blend of innovation, luck, and willpower. I don’t really define an output from entrepreneurship,
					because it’s so prone to failure. There’s a lot of varying “output” when in the entrepreneurship world – a lot of ventures
					fail. I value the effort, ingenuity and determination that people put into their ideas. I think the only consistent
					thing in the entrepreneurship is people believing in their ideas.
				</p>

				<p>
					I used to be a pre-med student. Being a doctor was my dream. I applied to a programming internship on a whim, and to my surprise,
					I was accepted. After doing the internship, I was absolutely sure I wanted to pursue computer science, but my love of
					medicine didn’t fade. I do research with a world-renowned plastic surgeon. I try to study public health and work with
					doctors as much as possible. I want to pursue the intersection of health and technology.
				</p>

				<p>
					I always try to pursue projects. I pursue a lot of programming projects, as seen on my <a href="https://github.com/afnanenayet">Github</a>.
					I’ve created apps, I’ve done research in computer science, and I even bootstrapped a prototype dashboard for a rover
					for NASA with a team at the College of William and Mary. I pursued a project with a professor: a defense contract to
					create virtual reality simulations of battles for the Department of Defense. In this role, I oversaw the project, besides
					the broad specs. I got to hire my own team, manage spending (though I couldn’t get too crazy). I got to meet with DoD
					employees in D.C. and advocate for my project.
				</p>
				Last year, I was the third member of a startup. We spent a lot of time trying to get the startup off the ground. It was a
				lot of fun, from the conception of the app, to looking for funding. We spent late nights hacking together demos, thinking
				of advertising campaigns, and just going through the grind so that we could create a product. It failed, but I’d gladly
				do it again.
				<p>

					<p>At the DEN LLC, I plan on pursuing a project with Dr. Joseph Rosen that plans to overhaul the Nepali healthcare system.
						We have managed to get the backing of the Nepali royal family as well as many members of the Nepali government. The
						idea is to create a truly modern healthcare system. I personally want to explore the role of big data and machine learning
						in a healthcare system, and hopefully test it out. It’s an extremely ambitious project, with room for a lot of people.
						I want to expand my team and see if we can create a better healthcare system. </p>

				<h2>The DEN and me</h2>
				<p>
					I have a good friend that I often spend time with when I’m doing my work. I remember when I took algorithms, she would ask
					me what I was doing, so I asked her a question.
				</p>

				<blockquote>You’re trying to guess a number. It’s between 0 and 10. You can only guess numbers, and I will tell you if the guessed
					number is too low, too high, or what I was looking for.
				</blockquote>

				<p>She’s a premed student. She doesn’t think she’s a computer person, but she was able to figure out a binary search very
					intuitively. I really enjoyed explaining that to her, and the other sorting algorithms I was reviewing.
				</p>

				<p>Almost every time I was working on some CS assignment and she happened to be in the study room with me, she would ask
					me what I was doing, and I would do my best to explain it to her. I realized I love doing this. I really enjoy trying
					to explain things to anyone who’s willing to listen. I started doing this with a lot of my friends, trying to pass around
					knowledge because I had a lot of fun doing it. I even started writing up <a href="https://github.com/afnanenayet/CS-50-notes/blob/master/2017_03_27.md">notes</a>					for my CS class so that my friends can use them (both at Dartmouth and elsewhere).
				</p>

				<p>I also really like working on projects with people. I’ve tried to form a startup, worked with people in big tech companies,
					on group projects, and research projects. I’ve always had a blast, and I will always try to pursue some new project
					with new people.
